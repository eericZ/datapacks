# Adapted tool datapack

When using the correct tool, some drops are increased.

## Rule of thumb

Better quality tool provides more resources, except gold that gives much more

Stone and iron gives have the same bonus and diamond and netherite too

## Known issue

Due to [MC-262347](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262347), luck cannot be applied properly.

So, this datapack uses predicate on luck effect instead of `bonus_roll` that could have made this pack a bit better. This makes the current valid amplifier for the luck effect between 0 and 1 (corresponding to Luck I and Luck II effects)
