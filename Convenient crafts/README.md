Convenient crafting, Quality of Life, balancing

Overall a more pleasant and easier Minecraft

## Some rules

More specific ways to craft things should yield more resources, using stone cutter should have better result than simply crafting if this does not break physics too much

It would be nice if craft yields a power of 2 items, or at least a even number of elements

## Changes

### Convenient crafting

Added some shortcuts for common crafting, loke turning logs directly into chests or sticks.

### Balancing

Balancing (or making crtafting produce more resources), this includes rails because not only minecarts are slow but very expansive.
